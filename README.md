# Programming and Scripting - Problem Sheets

This repository is my collection of work from each weekly task for Programing and Scripting, Spring 2022.

## Description

The work in this repository is my own, and was completed as part of my programming and scripting module. A folder has been created for each weekly task and all programmes related to that week are sorted accordingly. Comments inside of each script are used to demonstrate understanding of the method and code used. References are notated to the right inside the script and are further information of the references is provided below.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* Weeks 02 / 03 / 04 / 06. These weeks require a user input as part of the script, please read the instructions in the command line carefully to ensure the right data type is entered.
* Week 05 / 08. These weeks do not require any user input while being run.
* Week 07. This week requires a text file to read. the script should be run from the command line, where the script is first entered and then the file path is to be entered. Example: $ python es.py shrek.txt.
